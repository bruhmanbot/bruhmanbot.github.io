        <h2>Weights</h2>
        <p>In the final section, we will adjust the losing weight of our model to examine a good place
            for our bot(s). For this section, we pit our supercharged bot with 3 other normal bots using
            just the basic speed model from before. Due to the large amount of data used, where around
            1 million mahjong games were played in this section, I only kept the aggregated data for each weight
            to save on space and computation power. You can download the raw data below.

        <p>From the above 4 charts, we can get the following findings:
        <ul>
        <li>
            Wins increase as the weight goes towards 0 from the negative numbers. Into the positive numbers, the wins decrease.
        </li>
        <li>
            Losses slowly increase as we turn from the negatives to 0. Then there was a sharp increase at 0, followed
            by another slow but steady increase as we go into the positives.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tsumos increase for lower negative weights. Going into the positives, we once again see a decrease.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most importantly, the W/L ratio increases slowly. Then plateaus at the low 1.3s at -3 until -0.1.
            At 0, the W/L ratio is 1.25, a sharp decrease without the algorithm accounting for the dangerous tiles.
            After that, the W/L ratio decreases sharply as the algorithm starts to discard the most dangerous tiles, as expected.
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            To end things, a weight of -3 until -0.1 is generally sufficient to gaurantee an above 1.25 W/L ratio, which means
            that on average for every 4 direct losses, our player will win 5 times. If I was asked for one specific value,
            I would go for a weight of -2.5. This is the point at which the curve stay relatively flat while risking
            the least, noting that more negative weights deliver less losses, indicating more steady play.
