        <h2>Game Distrubution</h2>
        <p>This section examines the results generated using the script from the last section. We will cover the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Distrubution of length of games</li>
            <li>Winning Hands</li>
            <li>Stats regarding winners and losers</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Length of games <button id="exp_btn">Expand</button></h2>
        <div class="expand-on-clk" id="game-length-table-div">
            <p>Results for game length, taken over a sample size of 40000 games:</p>
        </div>

        <p>Graph of games ended against tiles used. Here tiles used is defined as tiles 
            taken from the deck since the start of the game (i.e. after everyone has drawn their first 16/17 tiles)</p>
        <div class="graph" id="game-length-graph"></div>
        <p>We can see that the distrubution spikes at around 40 tiles, which is further supported by the mean of this figure.
            The mean tiles used to end a game is 40.9 tiles, meaning that on average, after each player discards around 10 tiles,
            over half of Taiwanese Mahjong games would have ended. We can further fit our data to a 
            <abbr title="Probability Density Function">PDF</abbr>, and consequently a <abbr title="Cumalative Density Function">CDF</abbr>. 
            With the asymmetrical shape of the curve, a gamma distrubution was chosen.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Gamma Distrubution<button class="exp_btn" id="exp_btn2">Expand</button></h2>
        <div class="expand-on-clk" id="gamma-tbl"></div>
        <p>The gamma distrubution is defined as follows</p>
        <div>
            $$p(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(k)\theta^k} x^{k-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}}$$
            where
            $$\text{Mean} = \bar{x} = k\theta$$
        </div>
        <p>After plotting the curve and adjusting the value of the parameters <i>k</i> and <i>&theta;</i>.
            The two values were evntually settled on:
        </p>
        <div>
            $$k = 9.6 \text{ and } \theta = 4.26 $$
        </div>
        <p>The obtained PDF is then re-plotted on the same graph with the raw data, only with the number of total games
            multiplied with the predicted probabilty. The below graph is obtained.
        </p>
        <div class="graph" id="gamma-fit-graph"></div>
        <p>We can also do the same with the CDF graph.</p>
        <div class="graph" id="cdf-fit-graph"></div>
        <p>While this seems like a statistical observation for now, these figures will soon become handy when we calculate
            the losing chance of a tile since game length is a factor that affects it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Winning Hands</h2>
        <p>Here I will just show the occurences of different scores over the 40000 game sample above. 
            <button class="exp_btn" id="exp_btn3">Expand</button></p>
        <div class="expand-on-clk" id="score-tbl">
        </div>
        <div class="graph" id="score-graph"></div>
        <div class="graph" id="score-cum-graph"></div>
        <p>As expected, this distrubution is highly asymmetrical, with most data skewing towards the low end, just like a normal
            mahjong game where high scoring hands are very rare. Looking at the cumalative chart, we find the median of the distrubution to be 13,
            while the mean sits higher at around 19 points. Observant readers may be able to notice small spikes at 48-50 points and 58-60 points,
            this is mainly due to the two speciality hands - LiguLigu and 16不搭, being a significantly more common method to gaurantee scores at these ranges.
            Finally, let's take a look at some of the highest scoring hands.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>Some high scoring hands</h2>
        <p>Although flowers are included in the game, for simplicity I will not show them here. (also partly because I didn't record them
            to save space)

        <h2>Winners and Losers</h2>
        <p>Originally I wanted to only examine the average game length and average scores. However, using a pivot table,
            I was able to get data on the amount of times each user won (or lost). This was from an older dataset with only 10000
            games that I discarded due to discovering some bugs in my score counting algorithm. Still its size is sufficient to display
            my findings. In the below game(s), all the games following the following playing order: p4 (dealer) &#x2192; p1 &#x2192; p2
            &#x2192; p3 &#x2192; p4 &#x2192; ...

        </table>
        <p>The horizontal rows correspond to the winner, and the vertical row corresponds to the loser. For instance,
            there have been 658 games won by p1 where the winning tile was discarded by p4. The main diagonal corresponds to
            number of self-drawn victories. So we can see that p3 won by self-drawing 500 times.
        </p>
        <p>We can see the biggest outlier being p4, the dealer, with a staggering 620 times winning by self-drawing the last 
            tile. Knowing that all 4 players share the exact same skill, the only difference is that p4 is the dealer, i.e. the first
            to play. Hence, we can conclude that the dealer is the most favourable to win any given mahjong game. Another observation
            we can see is that each player loses to the previous player the most (with the exception of p3 here), by not an insignificant
            margin. My reasoning for this is mainly due to ups provided by the previous player. When the previous player discards a useful Tile
            for the next player to up, the next player is more likely to throw out a dangerous tile. Since this is mainly controlled by the
            previous player, he/she can be said to be the biggest beneficiary from this.
        </p>
        <p>For a set of control data, here are the results from another 16000 game sample, in this set of data, the dealer rotates after
            every game.

        <p>Here we see a more evenly distrubuted pattern of wins across the 4 players, indicating that the dealer advantage
            dicussed above is indeed real. However, we can still spot that each player generally loses the most to the previous
            player, a repeatedly occuring pattern across this dataset (and all others).
