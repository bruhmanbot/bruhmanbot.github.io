        <h2>Hand valuation</h2>
        <p>An age old question (and source of complaints) in mahjong games is how good or bad my hand is. This question may seem like a simple preference or
            one where the answer is wholly dependent on personal feelings. However, there are definitely cases where 'good' is a clear cut from 'bad'. Take the
            following example:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p class="caption">Hand 1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <table id="hand1"></table>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p class="caption">Hand 2</p>
                    
                </td>
                <td>
                    <table id="hand2"></table>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Now obviously nearly everyone would prefer to play with hand 1 over hand 2, the reason being it is much closing to winning.
            That raises a good approach to evaluate hands - one based on how close you are to winning. To win a game of Taiwanese mahjong,
            we need 5 sets of 3, plus an eye pair. Using this, we can assign scores to completed sets of 3 (either straights or triplets).
            To begin our model, we can simply assign 1 point for every completed sets. By this metric, hand 1 has 3 points, while hand 2 has 0.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, at the start of the game, we probably never have a completed set, but we can make completed sets from partial sets. 
            For instance, a set of (2-3) can become a straight upon getting a 4 tile (becoming 2-3-4 straight). With this knowledge, we can assign 0.5 points to
            any two tiles that can form a set with a third additional tile. The methods of this are shown below.
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>Some annotation on the last two types of partial sets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hole: Two tiles that can form a complete straight, when inserting the tile between them. <br>
                E.g. (3-5) can become a whole straight by inserting a (4) tile.
            </li>
            <li>
                Edge straight: A psuedo-open straight (1-2, or 8-9) which seems like an open straight, but since 0 tiles do not exist, only one tile
                can turn them into a complete straight.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These two types of partial sets are given less credit since they can only accept one tile to turn into a complete set. (A pair also only takes 1 tile but because you
            can take the tile from everyone on the table, it is significantly easier to get said tile compared to an edge straight or a hole-filling set.)
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p>Using this model, I tried to evaluate some hands on my own, which then quickly led to some trouble, best exemplified by the problem below:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p class="caption">Hand 3</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p class="caption">Score: 4.0</p>
                </td>
                <td class="left-border-div-cell">
                    <table id="hand3" ></table>
                </td>
                
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p class="caption">Hand 4</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p class="caption">Score: 4.0</p>
                </td>
                <td class="left-border-div-cell">
                    <table id="hand4"></table>
                </td>
                
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The two hands above are given the same score when using our chart above. However, upon quick inspection one would realise the second hand
            has much lower playability compared to the first one. This is especially easy to spot when an additional useful tile is drawn.
        </p>
        <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p class="caption">Hand 4.2</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p class="caption">Score: 4.5</p>
            </td>
            <td class="left-border-div-cell">
                <table id="hand4-2"></table>
            </td>
            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p class="caption">Hand 4.3</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p class="caption">Score: 4.0</p>
            </td>
            <td class="left-border-div-cell">
                <table id="hand4-3"></table>
            </td>
            
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Even though we gained a complete set and got closer to winning, our score is still the same, giving us the illusion that we aren't in a better situation.
            Hence, an adjustment is made to our model/system. Instead of valuing complete sets of three as 1.0 point, we value them at 2.0 points instead. This gives much
            higher priority to complete sets, which is inline with mahjong strategies.
