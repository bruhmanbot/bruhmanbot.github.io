        <h2>Future development</h2>
        <p>As with all projects, this one has a limited scope as well. I remember coming in
            to just create a program for counting score, but then that score soon expanded to what we have now.
            There are still a couple of things I want to create, but due to the limited time I have on hand,
            I unfortunately have no other choice but to temporarily put it aside. Here are the few things
            I originally had in mind.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A fully fledged GUI mahjong game with the new bots.</li>
            <li>Better integration for the bots to allow them to find the best move from a given position.</li>
            <li>A GUI program for users to analyse mahjong games, similar to engines in chess.</li>
            <li>Further analysis on other types of hands, e.g. Full flush, 1/9 hands, etc.</li>
            <li>Expansion of the model back to Cantonese Mahjong or Riichi.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Here is a recap of what I have found during the project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A reasonable method to assess the goodness of Mahjong hands.</li>
            <li>The probabilities for getting a "Good hand" at the start.</li>
            <li>The best discards one could make in different positions.</li>
            <li>How quickly a hand progresses with different play.</li>
            <li>The circumstances that make the specialty hands more favourable.</li>
            <li>The necessity of taking others' tiles.</li>
            <li>How long each game will last with computer play.</li>
            <li>The popularity of losing tiles.</li>
            <li>How to defend against potentially dangerous tiles.</li>
            <li>The optimal way to balance hand safety and efficiency.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With the knowledge, a mahjong model was constructed that can net a 30% edge over controlled algorithms
            that prioritised speed. Furthermore, insights as to how one should prioritise their goal based on
            their hands were found. Applying the principles and knowledge generated from this study to mahjong games
            can prove to be a consistent way of improving your odds. Though mahjong is a game mostly based off luck,
            skill is often enough to tip the balance.
