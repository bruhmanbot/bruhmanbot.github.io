        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Mahjong is inherently a game of luck, but no wins come without an element of skill.
            As an extension to my taiwanese mahjong counter, this component aims to generate a mathematically best method to approach the game.
            A model on evaluating the "goodness" of mahjong hands will be provided, and a CPU algorithm optimising the winning chances is created.
            Using the computer model, mahjong games can be simulated at a very fast rate, thus generating heaps of data which is further analysed to provide insights to the game.

        <h2>Taiwanese mahjong: The core differences</h2>
        <p>Cantonese mahjong (or Hong Kong mahjong) is a commonly played ruleset of mahjong. The modern ruleset first became popular in the 1970s, and continued to develop
            throughout the 20th century. As of now, a rule enforced most of the time is the '3-faan' rule, which requires players to end the game with a hand worth at least 3 faan.
            While the rule is mostly in place to facilitate players to go for higher scoring hands, it does inadvertantly lead to a more stale game with the playstyle being
            severely predictable and locked down.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           Due to these concerns, a newer style of play rose up using mainly the Taiwanese rules. In this ruleset, players play with 16 tiles, instead of the familiar 13 tiles.
           Moreover, there are significantly more accolades and ways to score high points, leading to a more diverse playstyle compared to Hong Kong style mahjong. Most importantly,
           however, is the addition of combo scoring which makes speed a priority instead of score, since combo-ing others to abuse the exponential increase in score is usually a more
           effective way to gain more money than plainly scoring big.
        </p>

                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

            </table>
            
        </div>
        

        <p>
            Owing to these differences, the model developed will focus on speed with an element of defense at play. Like most Taiwanese mahjong players, the model does not
            focus on gaining more points/accolades. For the purposes of the game, flowers do not play a huge role, so they are initially not considered. Later on, they were added
            back for simulation of real 4-player games, but it is important to note they play a minimal role in affecting gameplay.
