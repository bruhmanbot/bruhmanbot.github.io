        <h2>Losing Tiles</h2>
        <p>In this section I will present the statistics I gathered for the losing tiles to see which tiles
            are the most common (and by how much).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>The results<button id="exp_btn">Expand</button></h2>
        <div class="expand-on-clk" id="occ-tbl">
            <p>Occurences of different tiles as the losing/last tile:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="graph" id="occ-graph"></div>

        <p>As expected we see very little losses with lucky tiles as compared to normal tiles. While with the normal
            tiles, we see a concentration on tiles 2-7, with slightly fwer 8 tiles and nearly half as much 1/9 tiles as compared
            to the 2-7 tiles. I am unsure of what 8 tiles are not as common as the 2 tile. Mahjong tiles are symmetrical in nature,
            we should expect to see a symmetrical distrubution here. Although I have implemented randomisation to sometimes
            get the bot to favour the larger tiles, it seems as if this solution is insufficient to completely weed out
            the bias.
        </p>

        <p>Contrary to my initial belief, the 3/7 tiles were not the most popular. My further analysis on this came
            to the following conclusion: since edge straights are not valued as much by the bots, this only leaves 1
            possible open straight for the 3/7 tiles, (3 -> 4/5, and 7 -> 5/6) whereas the middle tiles (4/5/6) both
            have 2 possible open straights, leading to their high popularity.
